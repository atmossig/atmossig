# Hello
Hi, I like to program random stuff. You'll find mostly random things here, either finished or unfinished, or forks of projects I like to add stuff to. If you'd like to be friends, feel free to contact me on X or Instagram :D

# Currently working on
- Game Engine, repo online soon. (WIP, high priority)
- Frogger 2 for VS2022 (WIP, low priority)
- Lego Island improved (Forked from isle-portable of course, medium priority)
